## Goal ##

SBT native packager lets you build application packages in native formats. It offers
different archetypes for common configurations, such as simple Java apps or server applications.

## Issues/Discussions ##

*  **Discussion/Questions**:
  If you wish to ask questions about the native packager, we have a [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbt-native-packager) and
  we're very active on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sbt). You can either use the `sbt` tag or the
  `sbt-native-packager` tag.  They also have far better search support for working around issues.
* **Docs**:
  [Our docs are available online](http://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  If you'd like to help improve the docs, they're part of this
  repository in the `src/sphinx` directory. [ScalaDocs](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/latest/api/#package) are also available.

  The old documentation can be found [here](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/)
* **Issues/Feature Requests**:
  Finally, any bugs or features you find you need, please report to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/issues/new).
  Please check the [compatibility matrix](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/wiki/Tested-On) to see if your system is able to
  produce the packages you want.

## Features ##

* Build [native packages][formats] for different systems
  * Universal `zip`,`tar.gz`, `xz` archives
  * `deb` and `rpm` packages for Debian/RHEL based systems
  * `dmg` for OSX
  * `msi` for Windows
  * `docker` images
* Provide archetypes for common use cases
  * [Java application][] with start scripts for Linux, OSX and Windows
  * [Java server application][] adds support for service managers:s
    * Systemd
    * Systemv
    * Upstart
* Java8 [jdkpackager][] wrapper
* Optional JDeb integration for cross-platform Debian builds
* Optional Spotify docker client integration

## Installation ##

Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
// for autoplugins
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-native-packager" % "1.3.2")
```

In your `build.sbt` enable the plugin you want. For example the
`JavaAppPackaging`.

```scala
enablePlugins(JavaAppPackaging)
```
Or if you need a server with autostart support

```scala
enablePlugins(JavaServerAppPackaging)
```

## Build ##

If you have enabled one of the archetypes (app or server),
you can build your application with

```bash
sbt <config-scope>:packageBin
```

### Examples

```bash
# universal zip
sbt universal:packageBin

# debian package
sbt debian:packageBin

# rpm package
sbt rpm:packageBin

# docker image
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

Read more in the specific [format documentation][formats] on how to configure and build your package.

## Documentation ##

There's a complete "getting started" guide and more detailed topics available at [the sbt-native-packager site](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/).

Please feel free to [contribute documentation](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager/tree/master/src/sphinx), or raise issues where you feel it may be lacking.

## Contributing ##

Please read the [contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to build and test native-packager.

## Related SBT Plugins ##

These are a list of plugins that either use sbt-native-packager, provide additional features
or provide a richer API for a single packaging format.

- [sbt-aether](https://github.com/arktekk/sbt-aether-deploy)
- [sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly)
- [sbt-bundle](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-bundle)
- [sbt-docker](https://github.com/marcuslonnberg/sbt-docker)
  - This is in addition to the built-in [Docker Plugin](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/docker.html) from  sbt-native.  Both generate docker images. `sbt-docker` provides more customization abilities, while the `DockerPlugin` in this project  integrates more directly with predefined archetypes.
- [sbt-docker-containers](https://github.com/Dwolla/sbt-docker-containers) - enhances sbt-native-packager's docker functionality.
