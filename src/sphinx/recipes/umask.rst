.. _umask:

Setting the umask for your process
==================================

In Linux, the umask, associated with the user running the process, will determine what permissions files generated by the process,
such as log files, will have.

Within the start script
-------------------------------------

You can set the umask within the generated start script:

.. code-block:: scala

   bashScriptExtraDefines += "umask 077"

This line will be added just before the application will be executed by the start script and therefore the application process
will also inherit this umask. For more information take a look at the :ref:`according documentation<bash-script-defines>`.

.. hint:: When using :ref:`Docker<docker-plugin>` this is the only reliable way `right now <https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/19189>`_ to set the umask for the process. Docker `will ignore <https://stackoverflow.com/a/46900270/810109>`_ any umask set in e.g. `/etc/login.defs` (or other config files) within a docker image.

System V/systemd
----------------

When using the :ref:`java-server-plugin` usually the system default umask for daemons is fine and can be left unchanged,
however sometime the need arises to override it.

As an alternative to the start script approach described in the section above, to set a custom umask for
your application that is running either via a System V init script or systemd, the umask can be specified via
a custom ``/etc/default/appname`` file.

The contents of this file can be specified by creating a template at ``src/templates/etc-default`` and adding a line such as the following:


.. code-block:: bash

    umask 077
