.. _umask:

Setting the umask for your process
==================================

When using the :ref:`java-server-plugin`, the umask, associated with the user running the process, 
will determine what permissions files generated by the process, such as log file, will have.  Usually the system default umask
for daemons is fine and can be left unchanged, however sometime the need arises to oerride it.

System V/systemd
----------------

To set a custom umask for your application that is running either via a System V init script or systemd, the umask can be 
specified via a custom ``/etc/default/appname`` file.  The contents of this file can be specified by creating a template at 
``src/templates/etc-default`` and adding a line such as the following:


.. code-block:: bash

    umask 022
