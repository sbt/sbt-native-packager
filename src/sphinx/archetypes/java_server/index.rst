Java Server Application Archetype
#################################

.. hint:: Supports only **deb** and **rpm** packaging. No support for Windows or macOS

In the :ref:`java-app-plugin` section we described how to build and customize settings related to an application.
The server archetype adds additional features you may need when running your application as a service on a server.
SBT Native Packager ships with a set of predefined install and uninstall scripts for various platforms and service
managers.


Features
========

The *JavaServerAppPackaging* archetype depends on the :ref:`java-app-plugin` and adds the following features

* daemon user/group support
* default mappings for server applications
  * ``/var/log/<pkg>`` is symlinked from ``<install>/logs``
  * ``/var/run/<pkg>`` owned by ``daemonUser``
* ``etc-default`` support

Usage
=====

.. code-block:: scala

  enablePlugins(JavaServerAppPackaging)

Everything else works the same way as the :ref:`java-app-plugin`.

.. tip:: If you want your application to be registered as a service enable a :ref:`systemloaders` plugin.

Settings & Tasks
================

This is a non extensive list of important settings and tasks this plugin provides. All settings
have sensible defaults.

  ``daemonUser``
    User to start application daemon

  ``daemonUserUid``
    UID of daemonUser

  ``daemonGroup``
    Group to place daemonUser to

  ``daemonGroupGid``
    GID of daemonGroup

  ``daemonShell``
    Shell provided for the daemon user

  ``daemonStdoutLogFile``
    Filename stdout/stderr of application daemon. Now it's supported only in SystemV


Default Mappings
================

The java server archetype creates a default package structure with the following access rights. **<package>** is a
placeholder for your actual application name. By default this is ``normalizedName``.

===============================  ======  ===========  =======
Folder                           User    Permissions  Purpose
===============================  ======  ===========  =======
/usr/share/**<package>**         root    755 / (655)  static, non-changeable files
/etc/default/**<package>**       root    644          default config file
/etc/**<package>**               root    644          config folder -> link to /usr/share/**<package-name>**/conf
/var/run/**<package>**           daemon  644          if the application generates a pid on its own
/var/log/**<package>**           daemon  644          log folder -> symlinked from /usr/share/**<package>**/log
